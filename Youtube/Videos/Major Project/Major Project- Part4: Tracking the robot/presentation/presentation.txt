OBJECT TRACKING:

	Approach:

		1. Points are Marked for source and Destination.
		2. Box is drawn for identifying the object to track.
		3. A sliding window is used to identify if a block is occupied or free(All Blocks are free since no obstacle for now).
		4. An optimized path is drawn using A* Search Algorithm and commands are given.



	Issues:

		1. The commands being sent had some issues, leading to stopping of robot.
		2. The Source and Destination were being dragged to corners of grids(causes issues when grid size too big).
	 	3. Even with these issues the results were encouraging though.......


	After Modifications:

		We changed the grid size and fixed the issue of robot getting stuck again and again. The results were much better.
