OBSTACLE DETECTION:

	Approach:

		1. Using a color range in a given block, we determine whether it has obstacle or not.
		2. The grid contatining obstacle is then marked as occupied grid in A* search Algorithm.
		3. Path is then created avoiding the obstacle.

	Possible Issues:

		1. Using color to detect obstacle is not very reliable due to lighting conditions and other factors.
		2. Having particular lighting conditions at all times is impractical.
	 	3. Possible issues in multicolored environment or multicolored robot.


	Initial Trials:

		1. We used black color as the obstacle, the color range wasn't suitable resulting in all things being marked as obstacles.
		2. However, after modifying the range of colors, less false positive were obtained but still the results weren't helpful.





	Issues with robot control:

		1. The robot moves in ways that are not understood, this can be because we haven't taken heading of vehicle into account.
		2. Another issue is lag(Even though it is of the order of milliseconds), it may lead collisions.



	Later Trials:

		1. We Changed the color of obstacle to yellow, since black color is very common in the environment.
		2. The results obtained were much better, However there are still a lot of issues.
		3. At the end, we placed another black obstacle to see whether the model classifies, it as obstacle or not.
